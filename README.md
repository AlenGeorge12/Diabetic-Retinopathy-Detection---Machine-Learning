This is a diabetic retinopathy prediction system using python and Tensorflow library
We use convolutional neural networks to train the model on a dataset of images of diabetic retinopathy
The model predicts not only if the person has diabetic retinopathy but also the severity of the disaese
The pdf file attached is the dataset used to train the model and should be downloaded to train the model
